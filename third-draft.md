# Third Draft - Spiral Heroes

# About This Document

Since this document is a playtest and work in progress, some elements are still in flux. Text with a blue background is considered a “dial” or “toggle” - subject to adjustment and fine-tuning.

# Playing the Game

This is a game for one or more players. It can be played either as a standalone game, taking 2-3 hours, or across several sessions of play.

## Materials you need

You’ll need a set of polyhedral dice - a set of dice with 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 sides - and a way to take notes. If you are playing digitally, you can make a copy of a Character Keeper to track characters:

## What the game asks of you

As a player, you are in a group of creators, working collaboratively on a character-driven graphic novel or comic book. You will be creating a specific superhero character and narrating their actions. But you will also be shaping the world and the story as a whole.

Everyone in the group has authorial and editorial control over the fictional parts of the game. That means that you can create whatever new elements you want, and you can make suggestions about existing elements brought in by other people. Declare that a supervillain exists - announce that suddenly ninjas appear - introduce a bus full of school kids that are in peril - say that a teleporter whisks the bad guys away at the last moment - it’s all good.

The game will function best if you assert yourself in these roles. Please speak up when you have an idea to share. As a member of the group, you should also encourage other players to speak up even if they are hesitant to do so. You should also not speak over other people, and you should intervene if someone else is doing so. Defend your voice and the voices of others.

When players talk to each other about this creative process, they can speak in terms of comic book visuals - word balloons, panels and pages, visual and sound effects.

During a session, the players will create characters (if they haven’t done so already), then play through a crisis, then play through one or more optional downtime scenes. If the group is interested and there’s time left over, the group can start a new crisis during the same session and repeat the process.

Players shouldn’t create characters ahead of time, but it’s best if you come to a session with some kind of idea about a superhero character you’re excited about. If you have ideas about villains and comic-book peril and so on as well, so much the better.

Every player should at least glance through this document. There is no “Game Master” or other privileged player, so everyone should have at least some idea about how the rules work.

## Editor in Chief

If the group prefers, one player can take the role of Editor in Chief (EIC). This player won’t have a hero character. Instead, they focus on keeping track of elements in the Crisis, like villains, complications, and Drives.

In particular, the EIC’s purpose is to make sure that under-utilized Drives are kept relevant to the scenario, and that complications are not neglected. For example, the EIC might keep a countdown clock and every few actions, remind players about a Drive that hasn’t come up. They might also suggest ways to resolve an action or narrate for villains or civilians on the scene.

Any player can do all the things the EIC does. Groups should only use an EIC if they find that keeping track of these details at the same as everyone runs a hero is too complicated.

# Creating a Character

You might come to the table with no idea about a character. You might have an emotional arc or set of plot beats you want to hit, but no idea about superpowers and similar details. You might even have a fully baked hero concept you’ve always wanted to try.

Characters in this game are defined by two things: their power Facets (which change rarely) and their Drives (which change for every Crisis).

At the end of character creation, the group should introduce their characters to each other. This includes powers, backstories, ideas about story arcs, and so on.

## Power Facets

There is no menu of predefined superpowers to pick from. Players are free to declare that their characters’ powers are anything they can imagine - control of an element, a half-human, half-alien physiology, psychic mastery, and so on.

“Gravity control” and “super-muscles” are superpowers. But do you use your mastery of gravity to fly fast, pin enemies to the ground, or open black holes through which you travel? Do your super-muscles mean you punch hard, tank massive damage with your face, or leap long distances?

To describe what a character can do, pick from three of the following six facets of power:

- **Confront**: you’re good at going toe to toe with enemies, inflicting damage and taking punishment in return. Characters with built-in weapons, mastery of dangerous elements like fire, etc. all excel here.
- **Protect**: you focus on keeping yourself and others out of harm’s way, and can resist, negate, or redirect all kinds of dangers. Characters with force fields, tough skin, or regeneration shine here.
- **Maneuver**: you’re good at moving fast, staying hidden, or otherwise dominating the situation through positioning, wits, and tactics. Teleportation, super-speed, invisibility, super-intelligence, and flight are all typical powers.
- **Command**: your control of your body, your mind, an element, a force, or something else allows you to achieve amazing feats. Appropriate to characters with ice or gravity control, martial arts masters, and telekinetics.
- **Influence**: you can impress, persuade, intimidate, lead, or deceive people with displays of your power. Illusions, telepathy, flashy tricks, sonic powers, and more can be used for influence.
- **Adapt**: you have a broad array of options and can bring them into play as needed. Gadgeteers, magicians, characters who make creative use of their environment, and anyone else favoring variety are applicable here.

Assign a d10 to one facet, a d8 to another, and a d6 to a third. These are referred to as facet dice. You will roll these dice to make checks during play.

If you are called on to make a check that clearly belongs to a facet where you didn’t assign any dice, you roll a d4.

## Starting Moments

Every character carries memories with them. Some can seem trivial, but become the most important thing in the world at the right time.

Note down that you have a Moment, and assign a d10 to it. You can define what it is now - inspiring words from a mentor, thoughts about your family, a formative experience you had - but you don’t have to.

You can obtain new Moments after each Crisis has ended. You keep Moments until they are used.

# Crisis Scenes

A Crisis is a situation that demands a response from superheroes. A typical comic-book Crisis could be villains enacting awful plans, disasters (natural or otherwise) that threaten the populace, big moves from organized crime, or some other overwhelmingly powerful risk to life, liberty, and happiness.

The players create a Crisis together. First, each player defines their character’s Drives. Then, the group weaves these Drives together into a scenario - a high-level narrative that explains what’s happening. Finally, the group plays through the Crisis. They declare actions, make checks, and try and achieve a satisfying resolution to the story of the Crisis.

## Drives

Drives are how each player expresses what’s interesting to them in a scene. Drives are an editorial mandate, indicating that something or someone will be part of the current Crisis.

Drives are aspirational statements. “I’ll defeat my villainous nemesis”, “I’ll save the civilians”, “I’ll keep the Psychic Resonator out of the wrong hands”, “I’ll enact the Shadow Society’s agenda”, “I’ll impress my hot teammate”, and “I’ll prove myself the strongest hero” are all meaningful Drives.

You don’t write Drives in response to what will be in the scene - what you write for Drives determines the contents of the scene. If you write a Drive that says “I’ll take on a powerful villain”, the scene will have a villain. If a Drive says “keep my loved ones safe”, your loved ones are present and in jeopardy. If you write a Drive about a Psychic Resonator or a Shadow Society, those things exist.

For characters, a Drive is something that stirs strong emotions. They aren’t just abstract goals or vague intentions - they’re powerful, seductive, compelling. Drives are things they’d do foolish, dangerous things to achieve. Whether the character wanted the Drive to come up or not, it did, and now they must navigate it.

Drives are created first to ensure that every player’s authorial voice is heard. The resulting story should include input from everyone.

Drives can be specific or vague, depending on how clear you are on what you want to see in the scene. If you’ve just started playing, a vague Drive like “I’ll take on a powerful villain” or “I’ll look cool to everyone” is fine. If you have specific ideas or are developing a story arc for your character, you can write specific Drives like “defeat Professor Pulsar to avenge my fallen friends” or “save the bus-load of nuns”.

## Writing Drives

Write down four Drives for your character. You should share what you’ve written with other players. Drives are not intended to be private.

Try to include a mixture of Drives from the following categories: confrontations with someone else, other mission objectives (like rescuing someone or capturing something), the character’s personal goals and feelings, and relationships between teammates.

If everyone seems to share the same or similar Drive (e.g. “rescue the civilians”), the group can agree to make it a shared Drive. In this case, remove it from the characters’ individual sheets and note it somewhere as a shared Drive.

Rate each Drive with a number from 1 to 3. The higher the rating, the more difficult it will be to achieve the Drive, but also to see it thwarted.

The total ratings of each character’s individual Drives, plus any shared Drives, should be 7. For example, ratings of 3, 2, 1, 1 or 2, 2, 2, 1 would work.

> **Example Drives**
- A relationship with a villain. Name the villain and say what you want to do - defeat them, capture them, rehabilitate them, avenge yourself against them, and so on.
- Dealing with a natural disaster, such as a flood, tornado, earthquake, tsunami, etc., or an artificial or extraordinary disaster, such as a meteor, black hole, giant monster, runaway plasma explosion, etc.
- Attending to a group of people - the more specific, the better. “Save all the civilians” is okay, but “evacuate the trapped scientists” is more evocative and unique.
- A personal goal, such as achieving fame or notoriety, overcoming a weakness, impressing or intimidating someone else, developing a new power, etc.
- Advancing or changing your position on the team, promoting a team goal, striving for a leadership position, improving team morale, pursuing a rivalry with a teammate, or anything else that relates to your allies or the group as a whole.

## Weaving a Scenario

Once everyone has written their drives, the group should compare notes and find points of intersection. If there’s a villain on the loose, a dam about to burst, and a MacGuffin that was stolen, it’s logical to say the villain is using the MacGuffin to blow up the dam.

There can be two or more plot threads running through a scenario - not everything has to be connected. If a doctor needs the team’s help to evacuate a cancer patient, that doesn’t have to be related to the kaiju that’s destroying downtown. But wherever possible, make an effort to tie things together in ways that make sense.

During this process, it’s okay for players to rewrite their Drives to better match the needs of the scenario! But nobody should feel pressured to do so. Drives are about expressing what you want to see as a player, and it’s the responsibility of the group to respect and promote that.

Once everyone feels confident about the scenario, discuss the Pressure Point - when the team arrives on the scene, what will be the most critical thing that needs handling?

Finally, decide whether Safeties are on or off for the crisis. Safeties on means play is safer, but can take longer. Safeties off should be for tense, high-stakes confrontations where anything can happen. Safeties off also means that characters can share Drives, or even have conflicting Drives - will G-Whiz redeem the Red Menace, or will her teammate Charcoal take him down for good?

Some common scenario structures:

- The villain’s schemes endanger civilians (this is one I’ve used through many examples here)
- A conflict between villains spawns chaos and calamity!
- Natural disasters meet man-made malice!
- Human vices and desires go out of control when power is misused
- A civic function or society event is disrupted
- Invade a headquarters, base, hideout, or lair to thwart an ambition nearing fruition

# Playing through a Crisis

When the crisis scene begins, one or more characters should turn their attention to the entry point - the most immediate part of the crisis. They will use their powers or wits to handle it, then move onto other parts of the crisis. During play, failed rolls or partial successes can also introduce new problems to solve, or make existing problems worse.

There are two ways to decide when the scene ends. The first is by mutual consent - if everyone is satisfied with the outcome, that’s good enough. The second is to set a threshold - for example, an average of two resolved drives per character - that will trigger the end of the scene.

## Principles of play

While playing in the scene, try to follow these principles.

**Give problems a face**. We empathize with named, defined people over unknown masses or big crowds. If there’s civilians in danger, name a few of them or describe a family huddled in a car, or otherwise give them a human presence. Let the hero’s actions toward them stand in for the fate of the civilians as a whole. Make their problems personal.

**Make the heroes see things through**. It’s not enough to just pull someone out of a burning building and forget about them. The building threatens to collapse, or the rescued person tells the hero there’s someone else inside, or they’re having trouble breathing and need to be taken to the paramedics. Look for new problems that you can develop from a situation the players are invested in.

**Present tough, personal choices**. Create situations that set characters’ Drives in opposition, both for a single character and within the group. Stop the villain or rescue the hostage? Take it slow, or go in fast? Turn the villain over to the authorities, or avenge your friends?

**Create just a few more problems than there are heroes**. If there’s four heroes on the scene, have five challenges. Or six. They don’t all have to be equally disastrous - just create tension by making the heroes deliberately decide what to tackle.

**Don’t kill anyone.** There’s lots of ways for a team to fail at Drives like “save the civilians” without invoking mass slaughter. People can suffer from smoke inhalation or serious injuries. Families can be torn apart by raging flood waters. Residents can lose their homes to fire or other calamity. Similarly, villains should be captured or beaten, but not simply murdered.

**Exploit vulnerabilities**. If a hero is in the middle of pulling a family from a burning car suspended over a raging river, that’s the moment for the villain to strike. If a hero is holding up a collapsing ceiling, have something new come up that demands their attention too. If a hero has a villain in their sights, reveal a hostage, trap, or contingency.

**Circle back to the heroes’ chosen problems**. Chandler’s Law states, “When in doubt, have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand.” If nobody has a clear idea of what their next action should be, push forward a character’s Drive - preferably a Drive that hasn’t seen much play recently - by narrating something that happens in relation to the Drive, and then asking for a reaction. For example, if a character has a Drive like “defeat a villain”, have the villain make a move, like attacking civilians, and ask what the heroes are doing to stop that.

## Making checks

When there’s a challenge that needs to be overcome, you make a check to see how it plays out. You only need to roll if what you are doing is risky or uncertain. Ideally, every challenge will connect to someone’s Drives.

When the group agrees on what’s at stake, you pick a Power Facet or a Moment, and roll the die that matches its rating. Take the highest die and interpret the results.

- On a 1-2, you fail, and something wrong happens.
- On a 3-4, you succeed, but at a cost.
- On a 5+, you succeed. The higher the result, the better the effect.

Whenever you roll a Power Facet or Moment die, you will step it down by one size. The path for stepping down is d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4. So for example, if you roll a d10, the next time you roll that particular Facet or Moment, you’d roll a d8, and then a d6, and so on. Don’t step down past d4.

A check can mean a moment in time, or several seconds of back-and-forth fighting, or even minutes of dedicated rescue work. Make sure everyone agrees how much time will pass during a given check.

## Using Moments and Sparks of Hope

Moments can be used as though they were Power Facets. Moments step down like powers (e.g. reducing one die size) when used. They do not regenerate after Spiraling, however. If a Moment would step down to a d4, it is instead lost.

A Spark of Hope allows a character to “unresolve” a frustrated drive, either for themselves or someone else. This doesn’t remove any marks on its frustration track, but does give an opportunity to keep pursuing the Drive, hopefully to resolve it as fulfilled. Once used, the Spark of Hope is gone.

Characters start with a Moment. They can gain more Moments and Sparks of Hope during downtime.

## Oracle Checks

The group can also progress a situation or make a luck-based check by picking a die size and rolling it. Roll a d4 if things are already bad, a d6 for 50-50 odds, or a d8, d10, or d12 for increasingly better chances of a good outcome. This kind of roll is called an Oracle Check.

> **Example checks**
- Use the “control gravity” power to fling an enemy at a building. On a roll of 5+, the action might succeed and help fulfill a drive like “defeat the villain”. On a failure, it might frustrate a drive like “save everyone in danger”, as the building collapses around terrified civilians.
- Use the “create force fields” power to block an enemy’s charged-up energy blast. In this case the character is reacting to someone else’s action, but they still make the check.
- The characters kept a dam from bursting earlier, but there are still cracks in it. The group decides to make an Oracle Check. They decide the odds are 50-50, and so roll a d8 to see whether it’s holding. On a 5+, everything is fine. On a 3-4, what they did might not hold for long, and on a 1-2, it might need immediate attention - or burst open immediately!
> 

## Fulfilling and Frustrating Drives

Each Drive has two tracks: fulfilled and frustrated. You can fill each of these tracks a number of times equal to the Drive’s rating. For example, a Drive with rating 2 can have two marks of fulfillment and two marks of frustration on it. Marks on Drives cannot be undone - it’s possible for a Drive to be close to both fulfillment and frustration.

The easiest way to handle success or failure is to mark fulfillment or frustration on a character’s Drive. For example, if a character attacks a villain and fails, they can mark frustration on their “stop the villain” Drive (if they have one). Then, narrate how that Drive came closer to resolution - the villain was injured on success, an attempt at rescuing trapped civilians backfired on a failure, and so on. Success at a cost might mean fulfillment of one Drive and frustration of another - the hero was able to keep the civilians safe, but the villain got away.

When you would mark a Drive as frustrated or fulfilled and no marks are left, that Drive is resolved. The civilians are definitely safe, or the villain escaped to fight another day, or the dam burst after all, or whatever. The Drive cannot be pursued any further during the scene.

If all of a character’s Drives are frustrated, they are taken out of the scene. This doesn’t mean that they’re knocked unconscious, but it could. It can also mean they chase after the fleeing villain, leaving their teammates to deal with the rest of the crisis. It could mean they dedicate all their efforts to saving civilians, no matter what else happens. Whatever the specifics, though, that character can no longer take actions or make checks.

What does it mean to fulfill, frustrate, or resolve a yes-or-no, one-time binary Drive? What if you have a Drive like “take a massive hit and shake it off”, you could look at it a few ways. TODO

## Safeties On and Off

When Safeties are On, your Drives are only affected if you participated in rolling a check. For example, if two people have some variation on “save civilians” as a Drive, and one of them fails a check, only that character’s Drive will be frustrated. If the characters both made a team check, both of their Drives would be frustrated in that case, but not anyone else’s.

When Safeties are Off, any check or other action that would logically frustrate or fulfill anyone’s Drives will do so, as interpreted by the group as a whole. This means that two or three characters’ Drives could have frustration - or fulfillment - marked on a single roll!

The group should always agree when a check would apply to multiple Drives with Safeties Off.

## Complications and failures

Aside from frustrating a drive, failures and complications on a check could mean the following:

- A villain has the initiative, and someone must make a check to resist or avoid their next move
- An escalating situation gets out of hand and demands someone respond to it
- A new character is introduced, or an existing character is highlighted, and placed in (more) peril
- A new facet of an existing situation develops - e.g. during a powerful hurricane, power goes out at a vital facility

## Team Checks

Multiple characters can participate in a check. Everyone rolls their relevant Power or Moment die, and the check is based on the highest value rolled. However, everyone’s die steps down by a die size, and everyone’s Drives can be fulfilled or frustrated by the outcome, regardless of Safeties.

## Spiraling

To reset all your Power Facets to their original rating, you can “spiral” - engage in one of your Drives with an unhealthy single-mindedness and a sudden outpouring of power. It can be done at any time, even during combat.

When a character spirals, the group looks at the scene and collectively decides on a new complication for the situation. This can be collateral damage, distraction from something that demands attention, the arrival of a new enemy, and so on. This new complication should function as a Pressure Point, demanding immediate action from the team.

The good news is that your spiral can accomplish amazing feats. When you spiral, roll a check with a d12 to achieve something appropriate to what you’re feeling. This die does not step down the way power dice do. The new complication from a Spiral is in addition to any success at a cost that results from the roll, and the roll can still fail.

Spiraling resets your Power Facet dice to their normal values. It does not affect Moments.

> **Example Spiral**
G-Whiz thought she had the dam situation figured out. But now it’s showing cracks, and water is about to break through! This isn’t supposed to happen - she’s supposed to be a genius scientist! Her mounting frustration and hero complex combine, and she rips bits of material out of the town and landscape, jamming it all against the dam with her prodigious gravity powers! She rolls a d12 to see if it fixes the dam. It does, but the group decides that she’s also caused a lot of extra (and expensive) damage, and either scared or endangered a lot of people! Calming down the crowd and keeping them from being hurt becomes an immediate priority.
> 

# After the Crisis

## Playing through post-Crisis scenes

Once a Crisis scene ends, players should look at their resolved Drives and think back to how the scene went. Based on that, they can play through one or more scenes suggested by this outcome. Example scenes:

- A scene set immediately after the Crisis ends. For example, a character might engage with civilians who were rescued, attending to their needs and fears, or examine the wreckage of a building for clues about the villain’s motivation.
- A scene set some time after the Crisis, as a hero follows up on the Crisis itself or engages in other business. For example, a character who fulfilled a Drive to capture a villain might interrogate that villain in prison, or make a report to police or government agents about what happened.
- A scene set in the character’s civilian life, as we learn more about them as people or see the impact of their heroic life on their mundane existence. For example, we might see a character struggle to explain their mysterious absences to an employer or love interest, try to hold down a job, or pursue hobbies that keep them emotionally balanced.

Such a scene can be a brief summary (”I take my girlfriend Sally to her favorite restaurant to make up for ditching her at the theater, but it’s expensive”). It can also be a full-fledged interaction between characters, where the group takes on different roles. For example, a hero’s player might want to talk to the Feds about the Crisis, and ask other players to take up the role of Federal agents interested in the case.

The player of a hero doesn’t have to be the one to suggest a scene for a hero. If Alice wants to hear more about Bob’s character, she can use her editorial voice to suggest a scene. It’s up to Bob to go along with it, though.

## Developing Drives

Players should look for opportunities to develop Drives for the next Crisis. This might be a continuation of the same Drive (e.g. if “capture a villain” was frustrated, you can just re-use that Drive), or an evolution of an old Drive into a new one (e.g. moving from “keep the MacGuffin from being stolen” to “retrieve the MacGuffin”). You can also decide a given Drive is at its logical end, and think up an entirely new one for the next Crisis.

A Drive doesn’t have to be a standalone goal that only mattered during a single Crisis. It can be a milestone in a larger story arc. Characters interested in pursuing these longer-term stories can write a “meta Drive” for themselves, such as “I’ll thwart the villain Monstro” or “I’ll find the reason for all these giant monster attacks”. These don’t function as in-game Drives, but as notes for the player about the direction for future Drives.

## Earning Memories and Sparks of Hope

At the end of a Crisis, each player rolls a single d20, plus another d20 for every Drive they resolved - whether frustrated or fulfilled. Take the highest number shown on all the dice.

- On a 1-2, the situation goes badly or turns awkward, and the group should decide how.
- On a 3-8, no unusual interactions happen.
- On a 9-12, the character generates a d6 Moment.
- On a 13-16, the character generates a d8 Moment.
- On a 17-20, they generate either a d10 Moment, or a Spark of Hope.

Characters can hold onto 3 Moments and one Spark of Hope. The specifics of a Moment need not be declared when it’s generated. The player holding the Moment can do so then, or define it later by narrating a flashback to the specifics of what they experienced.

If a player engaged in a post-Crisis scene, these Memories might be based on those scenes, but don’t have to be.

# Letters to the Editor

At the end of each session, each player should imagine a “letter to the editor” - a message from a comic reader, giving their feedback about the action. The letters we’ll hear about should be a mixture of constructive feedback or opinion about the story and characters, and hopes or requests for future content.

Players should take turns reading their letter aloud. Every player whose characters or situations were mentioned in the letter should get an opportunity to respond at the end. This can mean coming up with new ideas for Drives, or even rebuilding a character’s powers in accordance with their concept.

Letters are not a substitute for safety tools or necessary conversations. If you have issues to resolve with another player, you should resolve those directly with the player. It is everyone’s responsibility to play safely with each other.
